# 2016_Election_Data_Analysis
An analysis on voting data from several counties across the U.S.

This project aimed to take data on the populations of different counties across the U.S. and attempt to make predictions based 
on that data. 

This project was split into 2 parts:


Part 1: 
  1. Merge and clean the data from separate files and pre-process for analysis
  2. Add columns to the data labeling each county by party
  3. Calculate means of the Republican and Democratic counties and perform t-tests on the statistical significance of these means
  4. Determine which variables are distinctly different between Republican and Democratic counties that would make strong predictor variables

Part 2:
  1. Create test and training datasets in order to perform several linear regression models on the predictor variables
     from part 1 and determine which variables perform best in these models
  2. Build classification models using different combinations of predictor variables and determine which models perform
     best with which variables
  3. Build multiple clustering models using different combinations of predictor variables and determine which models perform best
